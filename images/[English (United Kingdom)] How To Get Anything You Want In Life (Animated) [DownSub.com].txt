- [Narrator] How to get to anything

that you want in your life,

whether it's making a million dollars,

or traveling around the world,

or having an attractive partner,

or maybe you just want to
have an attractive body.

Whatever it is that you want,

there's three simple steps to getting it.

And in this video,

I'm gonna break down exactly
what these three steps are.

So step number one is to
actually get really clear

on what you want in detail,

because pretty much
everyone has this vague idea

that they want to be rich one day.

But what does that really mean to you?

Is rich having a million dollars,

or $5 million, or $10 million?

Or maybe you just want to make $5,000

or $10,000 every single month,

but you want to have the ability
to travel around the world.

So something that I tell
my clients to do actually

is to write down what your
ideal reality looks like.

So by the age of 40, how
much money do I want to have?

Where in the world do I want to live?

Do I want to have a partner?

By the age of 40,

how much of the world do I
want to have seen by then?

Do I want to travel around
Europe or South America?

Or maybe I don't want to do any traveling.

If you don't have that specific goal,

you have nothing to work towards.

And when you have nothing to work towards,

you can't reverse engineer success,

meaning you can't ask yourself,

what do I need to do today
to get to that end goal?

And where do I have to
be by the end of the year

to reach that end goal?

And I know this sounds like overly simple,

but I can't tell you just
how powerful this is.

And step number two is
you need to understand

and acknowledge that you
will have to make sacrifices

to get the thing that
you want in your life.

And you also have to really understand,

and write down the sacrifices
that you will need to make

in order to get something.

So, for example,

let's say that you wanted
to make a million dollars.

Well, if you want to
make a million dollars,

there's sacrifices that
are associated with that.

And one of them is typically

investing in some kind of mentor
to teach you how to do it.

Okay, so that's one of the sacrifices,

which is a financial sacrifice.

And when you make that
financial sacrifice,

it most likely will make
you feel uncomfortable.

So that's another sacrifice,

being willing and able to
get out of your comfort zone.

Okay?

But here's the thing.

Even when you hire a mentor,
it's not like a slot machine,

where you put in money then
something comes out, okay?

So not only do you have to invest,

but then you have to work hard,

and you have to be consistent,

and you again will have
to be uncomfortable.

Because maybe you want to learn how to

start your own social
media marketing agency,

or something like that.

If you want to do that, you
will have to learn how to sell.

And when you're brand new to selling,

it can be very uncomfortable.

Okay, so these are all the
things that are associated

with making a million dollars.

It's actually not as hard as you think.

It's not like hiking Mount
Everest, or something like that,

but it does take work, and
you have to really sit down,

and ask yourself, am I
willing to do this work

to get this thing, which
leads us to the third point.

And this is a very, very important point.

And it's something that
not many people do.

Once you know what you need to sacrifice,

you have to look at
yourself in the mirror,

in an empty room with
all the windows closed,

with your phone off, with
your computer closed,

with no noise and no sound around you.

And you have to ask yourself,

am I willing to make these
sacrifices to get what I want?

And here's the thing.

There's no right or wrong answer here.

Okay, I know on social media,

people will try to guilt trip you into,

how could you not want to get rich?

Or how could you be satisfied
with not having six pack abs?

The concept of telling someone

what their priorities should
be is very weird to me.

Okay, but the thing that
you need to understand

is if you're not willing
to make those sacrifices,

then you will not get that thing,

and you very quickly have to
move on to something else.

Because what happens to a lot of people

is they don't do this, and
then for four or five years,

they're like half in, half out.

They're like kind of doing
research on how to make money.

Or they're kind of doing
research on how to lose weight,

but they never ever commit,
and they're just wasting time.

So it's so critical that
you do this, and that's it.

That is literally the
recipe, or the formula,

to getting anything that
you want in your life.

And it's so critical that you do this,

because if you don't do this,

you will never get what you want,

or worse, you start
chasing the wrong thing.

And the bonus little tip
that I'll give you here

is you have to act with urgency.

You can't procrastinate.

You can't say, oh, I'll do this tomorrow.

Or, oh, I'll do this a week from now.

You have to act today, because
every second that goes by,

we are all one second closer to dying.

So that's it, thank you
so much for watching.
